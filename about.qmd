## This book is in its early drafting stages; many portions of the book are unfinished and all of it will go through significant revision and refinement.

This book is designed for beginner and novice R users, with chapters structured sequentially to introduce R step-by-step, starting with foundational topics and progressing to more complex material.

Chapters 1 to 3 introduce readers to R and RStudio. For those already somewhat familiar with R, these chapters may seem straightforward and can be skipped without issue.

Chapters 4 and 5 provide essential knowledge on basic R coding, commonly used in data analysis projects. It is advised to read these chapters thoroughly before moving on, as they lay the groundwork for more advanced topics.

Chapter 6 focuses on basic visualizations and plotting techniques. Readers will learn how to use base R functions for visual representation and will be introduced to `ggplot2`, a highly regarded package for data visualisation in R.

Chapter 7 covers loop, apply family, and function, topics that may pose a challenge for beginners. This chapter aims to equip readers with the skills needed for more efficient R coding. While not critical for initial learning, understanding these concepts will become increasingly important as one progresses in data analysis.

Chapters 8 and 9 delve into essential skills for data exploration and descriptive statistics. Mastering these will enable readers to gain deeper insights into their data and prepare them for more advanced analysis techniques.

Chapter 10 concludes the book by summarizing previous content and offering guidance on next steps to further enhance R and data analysis skills.

Each chapter kicks off with a quoteâ€”I hope you enjoy it! To wrap things up, each chapter ends with chapter summary and revision questions.

Happy learning!
