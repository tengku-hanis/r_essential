This book is intended for anyone interested in using R for applied statistical analysis and machine learning. I first encountered R (specifically RStudio) during my master’s studies, and it wasn’t an easy journey—especially as someone from a non-coding background. Initially, I was introduced to software like SPSS and STATA, and eventually R during my master's studies.R felt unfamiliar and complex by comparison to the previous software. However, those who could use R proficiently seemed impressive to me, which motivated me to keep going. Surprisingly, the learning process became much easier as I keep using R.

Looking back, I wish I had known certain things earlier or that experienced R users had shared their insights from the start. This book is my attempt to provide those insights, covering the key concepts and tips I wish I’d had when I started. I hope it sparks interest in R for others and helps them fully utilize its capabilities.
