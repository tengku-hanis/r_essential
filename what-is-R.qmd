## R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

That basically summarises this whole chapter.

Readers who are not interested in knowing more about R and its history can skip this chapter and move on to more practical chapters.

Well, for those who keep reading this, I guess you are interested to know more about the story of how R came to be. Do not worry, this chapter is only going to cover a short version of the history of R, so, that we can appreciate this software.

R was a successor of S language. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1991. R was made known to the public only in 1993. The R version 1.0.0 was released in 2000.

## RStudio and Posit

In 2009, a company known as RStudio, Inc. was founded by Joseph J. Allaire, which later developed the RStudio software. RStudio software is an integrated development environment (IDE) which helps make R more user-friendly, especially for those without a programming background. [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/) is unequivocally the most commonly used IDE for R software. The company, RStudio, Inc. later changed its corporation to a public benefit corporation (PBC) in 2020, thus, known as RStudio, PBC. Subsequently, in 2022, the company changed its name to [Posit Software, PBC](https://posit.co/) to cater to a larger demography of the data science community.

Despite the changes in Posit company, they still strongly support the development and maintenance of RStudio IDE specifically and R in general.

## Other IDEs

As you may have guessed, we going to use RStudio in this book. However, there are other IDEs available. A few that are more common are:

1.  [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)
2.  [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try)
3.  [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)

Given that RStudio is initially developed for R (currently we can use Python as well in RStudio), a lot of functionalities work seamlessly with R. Thus, make it easier for R beginners and novices to use it.

## Clouds

There are a few options to use R in a cloud. Meaning that we do not need to install anything on our machines.

1.  [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
2.  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3.  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

The first two clouds are free with limited use, though you need to make an account. Kaggle is totally free to use as far as I know. However, Kaggle does not have functions such as code completion which is very helpful to beginners. This function is available in the first two clouds.

However, if you are looking for something more familiar to RStudio, Posit Cloud is the best choice. The functionalities and the overall look of the Posit Cloud are identical to RStudio.
