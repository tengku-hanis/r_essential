Readers who are not interested in knowing more about R and its history can skip this chapter and move on to more practical chapters.

Well, for those who keep reading this, I guess you are interested to know more about the story of how R came to be. Do not worry, this chapter is only going to cover a short version of the history of R, so, that we can appreciate this software.

R was a successor of S language. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1991. R was made known to the public only in 1993. The R version 1.0.0 was released in 2000.

## RStudio and Posit

In 2009, a company known as RStudio, Inc. was founded by Joseph J. Allaire, which later developed the RStudio software. RStudio software is an integrated development environment (IDE) which helps make R more user-friendly, especially for those without a programming background. [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/downloads/) is unequivocally the most commonly used IDE for R software. The company, RStudio, Inc. later changed its corporation to a public benefit corporation (PBC), thus, known as RStudio, PBC. Subsequently, the company changed its name to [Posit Software, PBC](https://posit.co/) to cater to a larger demography of the data science community.

As of now, despite the changes in Posit company, they still strongly support the development and maintenance of RStudio IDE.
