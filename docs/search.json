    "text": "Welcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is in its early drafting stages; several chapters of the book are unfinished and all of it will go through significant revision and refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is intended for anyone interested in using R for applied statistical analysis and machine learning. I first encountered R (specifically RStudio) during my master’s studies, and it wasn’t an easy journey—especially as someone from a non-coding background. Initially, I was introduced to software like SPSS and STATA, and eventually R during my master’s studies. R felt unfamiliar and complex by comparison to the previous software. However, those who could use R proficiently seemed impressive to me, which motivated me to keep going. Surprisingly, the learning process became much easier as I keep using R.\nLooking back, I wish I had known certain things earlier or that experienced R users had shared their insights from the start. This book is my attempt to provide those insights, covering the key concepts and tips I wish I had had when I started. I hope it sparks interest in R for others and helps them fully utilize its capabilities.\nFinally, I just want to say thanks to my amazing wife, Asmaq, my parents, Tengku Mokhtar and Nor Malaysia, and my in-laws, Mazalan and Salmeh, for all their understanding. Writing this book means taking the time I would usually spend with them, and while they might not fully get my obsession with R and data analysis (especially my wife!), they’ve supported me every step of the way.\nTengku Muhammad Hanis Bin Tengku Mokhtar, PhD",

    "text": "This book is in its early drafting stages; many portions of the book are unfinished and all of it will go through significant revision and refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is designed for beginner and novice R users, with chapters structured sequentially to introduce R step-by-step, starting with foundational topics and progressing to more complex material.\nChapters 2 to 4 introduce readers to R and RStudio. For those already somewhat familiar with R, these chapters may seem straightforward and can be skipped without issue.\nChapters 5 and 6 provide essential knowledge on basic R coding, commonly used in data analysis projects. It is advised to read these chapters thoroughly before moving on, as they lay the groundwork for more advanced topics.\nChapter 7 focuses on basic visualizations and plotting techniques. Readers will learn how to use base R functions for visual representation and will be introduced to ggplot2, a highly regarded package for data visualisation in R.\nChapter 8 covers loop, function, and apply, a topic that may pose a challenge for beginners. This chapter aims to equip readers with the skills needed for more efficient R coding. While not critical for initial learning, understanding these concepts will become increasingly important as one progresses in data analysis.\nChapters 9 and 10 delve into essential skills for data exploration and descriptive statistics. Mastering these will enable readers to gain deeper insights into their data and prepare them for more advanced analysis techniques.\nChapter 11 concludes the book by summarizing previous content and offering guidance on next steps to further enhance R and data analysis skills.\nHappy learning!",

Do not worry, this chapter is only going to cover a short version of the history of R, so, that we can appreciate this software.\nR was a successor of S language. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1991. R was made known to the public only in 1993. The R version 1.0.0 was released in 2000.",

Allaire, which later developed the RStudio software. RStudio software is an integrated development environment (IDE) which helps make R more user-friendly, especially for those without a programming background. RStudio IDE is unequivocally the most commonly used IDE for R software. The company, RStudio, Inc. later changed its corporation to a public benefit corporation (PBC) in 2020, thus, known as RStudio, PBC. Subsequently, in 2022, the company changed its name to Posit Software, PBC to cater to a larger demography of the data science community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The logo of Posit Software, PBC.\n\n\n\nDespite the changes in Posit company, they still strongly support the development and maintenance of RStudio IDE specifically and R in general.",

Contrary, to a vector which contains only a single row or a single column.\n\nmat_data &lt;- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)\nmat_data\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\nBy using str() function, we can see that the values are numerical and we have a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns.\n\nstr(mat_data)\n\n num [1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nNext, we can confirm that our data is a matrix by using is.matrix().\n\nis.matrix(mat_data)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Array\nAn array is quite similar to a matrix except that it can contain several layers of rows and columns.\n\narr_data &lt;- array(data = c(1:6, 10:16), dim = c(2, 3, 2))\narr_data\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   10   12   14\n[2,]   11   13   15\n\n\nAs we can see, we have an array of 2 layers with each layer having 2 rows and 3 columns. By using the str() function, we can see that R recognises the array has integer values with 3 dimensions. The first dimension, 1:2 refers to the rows, the second dimension, 1:3 refers to the columns, and the last dimension, 1:2 refers to the layers.\n\nstr(arr_data)\n\n int [1:2, 1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 13 ...\n\n\nis.array() can be used to ensure the data structure.\n\nis.array(arr_data)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Data frame\nA data frame is the extension of the matrix data structure. The difference between the former and the latter, the former contains the column names and each column may contain different data types.\n\ndf_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = 1:5,\n  Name = c(\"Mamat\", \"Abu\", \"Ali\", \"Chong\", \"Eva\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 35, 28),\n  Score = c(89, 95, 76, 88, 92)\n)\ndf_data\n\n  ID  Name Age Score\n1  1 Mamat  25    89\n2  2   Abu  30    95\n3  3   Ali  22    76\n4  4 Chong  35    88\n5  5   Eva  28    92\n\n\nWe can further check the data structure and type using str(). So, our data structure is a data frame, consisting of 4 columns; the first column is an integer, the second column is a character, third and fourth columns are numeric.\n\nstr(df_data)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ ID   : int  1 2 3 4 5\n $ Name : chr  \"Mamat\" \"Abu\" \"Ali\" \"Chong\" ...\n $ Age  : num  25 30 22 35 28\n $ Score: num  89 95 76 88 92\n\n\nWe can double-check the data structure using is.data.frame().\n\nis.data.frame(df_data)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n4.4.5 List\nLastly, we have a list. So, the list is a more advanced data structure in which we can have different data structures in a data structure. Let us see the example of a list in which we combine the previous vector and matrix data structures.\n\nlist_data &lt;- list(\n  \"vector\" = vec_data,\n  \"matrix\" = mat_data\n)\nlist_data\n\n$vector\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n$matrix\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\nWe can further assess each data in the list using the $ symbol.\n\nlist_data$vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nBy using str(), we see our data is a list with 2 elements or components; a vector and matrix.\n\nstr(list_data)\n\nList of 2\n $ vector: num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n $ matrix: num [1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nTo further confirm our data is a list, we can use is.list().\n\nis.list(list_data)\n\n[1] TRUE",

You can run data() in the Console to see what are the data available in R.\n\ndata()\n\nSo, for example, if you want to load any of these data, you can type the name of the datasets. You will see under the Environment pane, the chickWeight dataset is loaded to your environment.\n\ndata(\"ChickWeight\")\n\nAdditionally, it is quite common that R packages have their own datasets as well. We will see this many times in this book going forward. Lastly, R is capable of reading different data formats.\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Common data formats and corresponding R codes for reading them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nR codes\n\n\n\n\n.csv\nread.csv()\n\n\n.sav (SPSS)\nhaven::read_sav()\n\n\n.xlsx (Excel)\nreadxl::read_excel()\n\n\n.txt\nread.table()\n\n\n.dta (STATA)\nhaven::read_dta()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data formats that can be read are limited to the one listed in the table. Almost all data formats can be read in R. An efficient way to know whether R is capable of reading certain data formats by just a quick Google search.\nFor the rest of the chapter we going to the iris dataset, which is already available in R.

    "text": "4.6 Packages\nA package is a collection of functions and sample data that can be utilised for certain tasks. Certain functions in R are already loaded when you open R or RStudio. However, to use more advanced functions we need to install and load a package.\nThe packages can installed using install.packages(). For example, the code below will install the dplyr package which is commonly utilised for data wrangling and manipulation.\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nTo use the installed packages, we need to load the packages using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nNow, that we know what is a package, we might wonder where exactly these packages coming from.\nThe official packages in R are located in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This link contains all available packages in CRAN. Additionally, there is CRAN Task Views. At the time of this writing, CRAN contains 21,606 R packages intended for various tasks.\nFurthermore, for those interested in bioinformatics, the related packages are located in the Bioconductor. At the time of this writing, Bioconductor contains 2,289 R packages related to bioinformatics.\nIn addition to CRAN and Bioconductor, there are unofficial R packages, which are usually located in GitHub and GitLab. There are probably thousands of these unofficial packages. For example, dmetar which is located in GitHub, contains R functions and codes to facilitate the conduction of meta-analyses.\nMore often than not, the official packages in CRAN also have their GitHub repositories in which they contain the latest development of R functions and codes before they going to be released in CRAN. So, current bugs and errors in the package are corrected first using the unofficial packages from GitHub or GitLab before they are eventually released to the CRAN repositories.\nSeveral packages can help in installing the unofficial packages. The two most commonly used packages are devtools and remote (or at least I commonly used them).\nFirst, we need to install the packages.\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"remote\")\n\nNext, we can install the unofficial packages.\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"MathiasHarrer/dmetar\")\nremotes::install_github(\"MathiasHarrer/dmetar\")\n\nMathiasHarrer refers to the GitHub account or usually the author’s account on GitHub, followed by the name of the package. Depending on one’s preference, we can choose to use either devtools or remote.",

For example, the mean() function is designed to find the mean or average across the numeric values. The numeric values are the argument that we need to supply to the function.\n\nnum_values &lt;- c(5, 6, 8, 10)\nmean(num_values)\n\n[1] 7.25\n\n\nThe base R itself has numerous functions that are accessible to us. These base R functions can be used immediately once we open R (or RStudio or any other IDEs). In contrast, we also have R functions from the packages that we installed. First, we need to install the packages.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nWe will learn about tidyverse in a little bit. Coming on to our current installation, once you install the package there are two ways to use the function inside the package. First, by loading the package, subsequently, all the functions in the package are ready to be used by us. For example below, bind_rows() is one of the functions from the dplyr package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(dplyr) \n\n# Example of functions from dplyr package\nbind_rows()\nbind_cols()\n\nSecondly, we can use :: to access a single function that we are interested in. However, in this approach, only a single function is loaded.\n\n# Example of dplyr functions\ndplyr::bind_rows()\ndplyr::bind_cols()\n\nAs we can see, every time we want to call a function from the dplyr package we type dplyr:: as we do not load the package first.",

    "section": "4.9 Pipe operators",
    "text": "4.9 Pipe operators\nThere are two types of pipe in R:\n\n|&gt;: this pipe is from base R, first introduced in R version 4.1.0.\n%&gt;%: this pipe is from the magrittr package, which presented tidyverse.\n\nTo use |&gt;, we do not actually need to load anything as it is already available in base R. However, to use %&gt;%, you need to load tidyverse. Certain tidyverse associated packages such as dplyr, forcats, and magrittr also load the %&gt;%.\nThe main function of these pipe operators (regardless of which one we use) is to make our R codes more readable and intuitive. So, let us compare the codes without and with the pipe.\n\nmean_value &lt;- mean(\n  subset(\n    data.frame(value = 1:10, group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 5)),\n    group == \"A\"\n  )$value\n)\nmean_value\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nNow, compare the codes with the pipe.\n\nmean_value &lt;- data.frame(value = 1:10, group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 5)) |&gt;\n  subset(group == \"A\") |&gt;\n  with(mean(value))\nmean_value\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nBasically, what we do in both R codes are:\n\nCreate a data frame with ten rows and two columns.\n\ndata.frame(value = 1:10, group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 5))\n\n   value group\n1      1     A\n2      2     A\n3      3     A\n4      4     A\n5      5     A\n6      6     B\n7      7     B\n8      8     B\n9      9     B\n10    10     B\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter out the group column to value A.\n\ndata.frame(value = 1:10, group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 5)) |&gt;\n  subset(group == \"A\")\n\n  value group\n1     1     A\n2     2     A\n3     3     A\n4     4     A\n5     5     A\n\n\nCalculate the mean.\n\nmean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nComing back to both R codes, we can intuitively see that the codes with the pipe are more readable and clear compared to the other one. The codes with pipe can be read line by line, while the codes without the pipe need to be read inside out. As you can imagine, once our codes are more complex, the less readable the codes will become.\nSo, which pipe operators to choose?\nIn most cases, the differences are not significant enough to impact your code. Therefore, you can choose the pipe operator that best suits your preference or coding style. Most users will find that both options perform similarly for general tasks, so selecting one often comes down to familiarity or ease of use.\n|&gt; is a built-in pipe operator which can be used immediately without the need to load any package. %&gt;% can be used once the tidyverse package is loaded. The latter pipe has short cut built-in in RStudio. For Windows user, Ctrl + Shift + M and for Mac user, Cmd + Shift + M. Additionally, we can set up the shortcut for |&gt; or further change the shortcut for %&gt;%, though, this will not be covered in this book.",

For example, to select the first row and the first column:\n\n# Approach 1\niris[1, 1]\n\n[1] 5.1\n\n# Approach 2\niris[1, \"Sepal.Length\"]\n\n[1] 5.1\n\n\nTo select the first five rows and the first two columns:\n\n# Approach 1\niris[1:5, 1:2]\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n\n# Approach 2\niris[1:5, c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\")]\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n\n\nFor selecting a single column, an easier approach is to use $:\n\niris$Petal.Length\n\n\n\n[1] 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Selecting and slicing\nIn R, there are many ways to perform tasks. Rather than using [], dplyr provides select() and slice(), which are often preferred for their readability. The dplyr package is part of the tidyverse.\nThe select() function is used to choose specific columns.\n\n# Select a single column\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length)\n\n\n\n  Sepal.Length\n1          5.1\n2          4.9\n3          4.7\n4          4.6\n5          5.0\n6          5.4\n\n\n\n# Select several columns\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)\n\n\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width\n1          5.1         3.5\n2          4.9         3.0\n3          4.7         3.2\n4          4.6         3.1\n5          5.0         3.6\n6          5.4         3.9\n\n\nSimilarly, slice() is used to extract specific rows.\n\n# Select a single row\niris %&gt;% \n  slice(100)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width    Species\n1          5.7         2.8          4.1         1.3 versicolor\n\n\n\n# Select several rows\niris %&gt;% \n  slice(2, 5, 100)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width    Species\n1          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2     setosa\n2          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2     setosa\n3          5.7         2.8          4.1         1.3 versicolor\n\n\nBy combining both select() and slice(), we can access specific rows and columns.\n\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:5)\n\n  Sepal.Length\n1          5.1\n2          4.9\n3          4.7\n4          4.6\n5          5.0",

    "text": "5.7 Change data format\nData can be structured in two primary formats:\n\nLong format: Each row represents a single observation.\nWide format: Each subject has one row, with variables across columns.\n\nIn long format, each row represents a single observation. This format is commonly used for data manipulation and analysis. Let’s create an example of a long-format dataset. Here, five participants were given a dietary supplement to reduce weight, and the data contains:\n\nid: participant ID\ntime: either pre- or post-supplement\nweight: participant’s weight\n\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123) \n\n# Create a long format data\ndata_long &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = rep(1:5, each = 2),        \n  time = rep(c(\"Pre\", \"Post\"), 5),   \n  weight =  sample(x = 60:80, size = 10, replace = TRUE)              \n  )\n\n# View the data\ndata_long\n\n   id time weight\n1   1  Pre     74\n2   1 Post     78\n3   2  Pre     73\n4   2 Post     62\n5   3  Pre     69\n6   3 Post     77\n7   4  Pre     70\n8   4 Post     64\n9   5  Pre     79\n10  5 Post     73\n\n\nIn wide format, each subject has a single row, with each measurement in a separate column. Here is data_long converted to wide format.\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Create a wide format data\ndata_wide &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = 1:5,\n  Pre = sample(60:80, 5, replace = TRUE),\n  Post = sample(60:80, 5, replace = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# View the data\ndata_wide\n\n  id Pre Post\n1  1  74   77\n2  2  78   70\n3  3  73   64\n4  4  62   79\n5  5  69   73\n\n\nIn the wide format, data is often easier to interpret. Converting between long and wide formats is simple in R. To transform data_wide into long format, use pivot_longer():\n\ndata_long2 &lt;- \n  data_wide %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = 2:3, names_to = \"time\", values_to = \"weight\")\ndata_long2\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n      id time  weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1 Pre       74\n 2     1 Post      77\n 3     2 Pre       78\n 4     2 Post      70\n 5     3 Pre       73\n 6     3 Post      64\n 7     4 Pre       62\n 8     4 Post      79\n 9     5 Pre       69\n10     5 Post      73\n\n\nFor pivot_longer(), we need to supply three arguments:\n\ncols: columns to be changed into a long format excluding the id column\nnames_to: name of a new column which consist of column names from a wide format data\nvalues_to: name of a new column which consist of values from cols\n\nTo convert data_long2 back to wide format, use pivot_wider():\n\ndata_wide2 &lt;- \n  data_long2 %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = \"id\", names_from = \"time\", values_from = \"weight\")\ndata_wide2\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n     id   Pre  Post\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1    74    77\n2     2    78    70\n3     3    73    64\n4     4    62    79\n5     5    69    73\n\n\nTo use pivot_wider(), the three basic arguments needed are:\n\nid_cols: ID column\nnames_from: name of a column to get the column names for the wide data\nvalues_from: name of a column to get the values from\n\nBoth functions have additional arguments detailed in the Help pane (use ? in front of the function name).",

    "text": "5.8 Change variable type\nHere are the main variable types in R:\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Example of each of variable type in R.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nInteger\n100, 77\n\n\nNumeric\n100.2, 77.8\n\n\nCharacter\n“hello”, “ahmad”\n\n\nLogical\nTRUE, FALSE\n\n\nFactor\n“male”, “female”\n\n\nDate\n9/7/2024, 9 July 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common types in data are numeric, factor, and date. When importing data from software such as SPSS, STATA, or Excel, R may not always recognise the correct types. Let’s create a sample dataset and explore handling these issues.\n\n# Create a data frame with mixed-up variable types\ndata_messed_up &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = as.character(1:6),                \n  score = as.character(sample(1:100, 6)),    \n  gender = rep(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), length.out = 6)\n  )\n\n# View the variable types\nstr(data_messed_up)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ id    : chr  \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ score : chr  \"25\" \"90\" \"91\" \"69\" ...\n $ gender: chr  \"Male\" \"Female\" \"Male\" \"Female\" ...\n\n# View the data\ndata_messed_up\n\n  id score gender\n1  1    25   Male\n2  2    90 Female\n3  3    91   Male\n4  4    69 Female\n5  5    98   Male\n6  6    57 Female\n\n\nWe can see that score should be numeric and gender a factor. To convert these types, use as.numeric() and as.factor(). Let’s create a copy of data_messed_up for demonstration purposes.\n\ndata_messed_up2 &lt;- data_messed_up\n\nUsing base R functions, we can adjust the types:\n\n# Change score column to numeric\ndata_messed_up$score &lt;- as.numeric(data_messed_up$score)\n\n# Change gender column to factor\ndata_messed_up$gender &lt;- as.factor(data_messed_up$gender)\n\n# View variable type\nstr(data_messed_up)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ id    : chr  \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ score : num  25 90 91 69 98 57\n $ gender: Factor w/ 2 levels \"Female\",\"Male\": 2 1 2 1 2 1\n\n\nUsing tidyverse, we can achieve the same result with mutate():\n\n# Change variable types for score and gender\ndata_messed_up2 &lt;- \n  data_messed_up2 %&gt;% \n  mutate(score = as.numeric(score),\n         gender = as.factor(gender))\n\n# View variable type\nstr(data_messed_up2)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ id    : chr  \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ score : num  25 90 91 69 98 57\n $ gender: Factor w/ 2 levels \"Female\",\"Male\": 2 1 2 1 2 1\n\n\n\n5.8.1 Handling date\nDates can be tricky. For date variables, the standard format is YYYY-MM-DD. Using lubridate, we can work with various date formats easily. Let’s look at a few examples:\n\n# Using base R \ndate_data &lt;- as.Date(\"2024-11-30\")\nstr(date_data)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2024-11-30\"\n\n# Using lubridate\ndate_data2 &lt;- as_date(\"2024-11-30\")\nstr(date_data2)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2024-11-30\"\n\n\nFor non-standard formats, use lubridate functions ymd(), dmy(), and mdy().\n\n# DD-MM-YYYY\ndate_data3 &lt;- dmy(\"30-11-2024\")\nstr(date_data3)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2024-11-30\"\n\n# MM-DD-YY\ndate_data4 &lt;- mdy(\"11-30-2024\")\nstr(date_data4)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2024-11-30\"\n\n\nCorrectly formatted date variables allow for operations such as:\n\nDate calculation: adding days to a date.\n\ndate_data4 + 7 \n\n[1] \"2024-12-07\"\n\n\nExtracting date components usch as month and year.\n\n# Extract month\nmonth(date_data4)\n\n[1] 11\n\n# Extract year\nyear(date_data4)\n\n[1] 2024\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate dates in a dataset, we’ll recreate data_messed_up with a date column.\n\n# Create a data frame with mixed-up variable types\ndata_messed_up &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = as.character(1:6),                \n  score = as.character(sample(1:100, 6)),    \n  gender = rep(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), length.out = 6),\n  date = as.character(Sys.Date() - 1:6)\n  )\n\n# View variable type\nstr(data_messed_up)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ id    : chr  \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ score : chr  \"92\" \"9\" \"93\" \"72\" ...\n $ gender: chr  \"Male\" \"Female\" \"Male\" \"Female\" ...\n $ date  : chr  \"2024-11-11\" \"2024-11-10\" \"2024-11-09\" \"2024-11-08\" ...\n\n\nThe date column is recognised as a character. To convert date to a date format, use as_date().\n\n# Change variable types for score, gender, and date\ndata_messed_up &lt;- \n  data_messed_up %&gt;% \n  mutate(score = as.numeric(score),\n         gender = as.factor(gender),\n         date = as_date(date))\n\n# View variable type\nstr(data_messed_up)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ id    : chr  \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ score : num  92 9 93 72 26 7\n $ gender: Factor w/ 2 levels \"Female\",\"Male\": 2 1 2 1 2 1\n $ date  : Date, format: \"2024-11-11\" \"2024-11-10\" ...\n\n\nThe simplest solution for the date issue is to make sure we properly input the date according to the right format (YYYY-MM-DD) during the data collection process properly.",

    "text": "5.9 Merge datasets\nIf you collect data from different sources, you may need to combine datasets by row or column. rbind() combines datasets by row, while cbind() combines them by column.\nLet us see how to combine two iris datasets.\n\n# Data collected from area A\ndata1 &lt;- iris\n\n# Data collected from area B\ndata2 &lt;- iris\n\n# Combine both datasets by a row\ndata_combined_row &lt;- rbind(data1, data2)\n\nNow, we can check the dimensions of the data. The first element represents a row and the second element represents the column.\n\n# Dimension of data1\ndim(data1)\n\n[1] 150   5\n\n# Dimension of data2\ndim(data2)\n\n[1] 150   5\n\n# Dimension of the combined data\ndim(data_combined_row)\n\n[1] 300   5\n\n\nWe can see that the rows of data1 and data2 each are 150. Combining both data by a row gives us 300 rows. It is to be noted that to use rbind(), both data should have the same column numbers and names. Additionally, rbind() is not limited to two data only.\nNext, let us see the cbind(). Using the same data, we can combine both data by a column.\n\n# Combine both datasets by a column\ndata_combined_col &lt;- cbind(data1, data2)\n\nThus, by further checking the dimension, we can see that the total column of data_combined_col is 10, which is the sum of 5 columns in each of the data1 and data2, while the row remained the same.\n\n# Dimension of data1\ndim(data1)\n\n[1] 150   5\n\n# Dimension of data2\ndim(data2)\n\n[1] 150   5\n\n# Dimension of the combined data\ndim(data_combined_col)\n\n[1] 150  10\n\n\nHowever, similar to rbind(), to use the cbind(), the rows of both data should be identical. If participant A is in the first row of data1, the, in data2, participant A should also be in the first row.\nThere is another set of functions that is more efficient than cbind(), in which we can combine two or more datasets according to the id. Let us create two datasets that are related and have the same ID.\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Create the first half of the data\ndata_half1 &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Ahmad\", \"Ali\", \"Cheng\", \"Rama\", \"Wei\"),\n  height_cm = sample(160:180, 5, replace = FALSE)\n  )\n\n# Create the second half of the data\ndata_half2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Ahmad\", \"Ali\", \"Cheng\", \"Rama\", \"Karim\"),\n  weight_kg = sample(70:90, 5, replace = FALSE)\n  )\n\n# The first dataset\ndata_half1\n\n   name height_cm\n1 Ahmad       174\n2   Ali       178\n3 Cheng       173\n4  Rama       162\n5   Wei       169\n\n# The second dataset\ndata_half2\n\n   name weight_kg\n1 Ahmad        87\n2   Ali        80\n3 Cheng        74\n4  Rama        83\n5 Karim        88\n\n\nNotice that the last row of both datasets is not similar. To combine both datasets, we can use either left_join() or right_join(). Both produce the same result. If there is a mismatch between the two datasets, left_join() will keep the first dataset as a reference, and any of the id of the second dataset that does not match the first one will be removed. right_join() works similar to the left_join() but in the opposite.\n\n# Combine the data\ndata_full_left &lt;- \n  data_half1 %&gt;% #first datasets\n  left_join(data_half2, by = \"name\") #second datasets\n\n# View the combined data\ndata_full_left\n\n   name height_cm weight_kg\n1 Ahmad       174        87\n2   Ali       178        80\n3 Cheng       173        74\n4  Rama       162        83\n5   Wei       169        NA\n\n\nWe can see that karim in the second dataset is excluded. Let’s see what will happen if we use right_join().\n\n# Combine the data\ndata_full_right &lt;- \n  data_half1 %&gt;% #first datasets\n  right_join(data_half2, by = \"name\") #second datasets\n\n# View the combined data\ndata_full_right\n\n   name height_cm weight_kg\n1 Ahmad       174        87\n2   Ali       178        80\n3 Cheng       173        74\n4  Rama       162        83\n5 Karim        NA        88\n\n\nWe can see that Wei in the first dataset is excluded. To include all the participants, despite the mismatch of the id is by using full_join().\n\n# Combine the data\ndata_full &lt;- \n  data_half1 %&gt;% \n  full_join(data_half2, by = \"name\") \n\n# View the combined data\ndata_full\n\n   name height_cm weight_kg\n1 Ahmad       174        87\n2   Ali       178        80\n3 Cheng       173        74\n4  Rama       162        83\n5   Wei       169        NA\n6 Karim        NA        88\n\n\nBoth Wei and Karim are kept in the combined dataset. Additionally, there is inner_join(), which will exclude both Wei and Karim. This function keeps the data that the name is present in both datasets only.\n\n# Combine the data\ndata_full_inner &lt;- \n  data_half1 %&gt;% \n  inner_join(data_half2, by = \"name\") \n\n# View the combined data\ndata_full_inner\n\n   name height_cm weight_kg\n1 Ahmad       174        87\n2   Ali       178        80\n3 Cheng       173        74\n4  Rama       162        83",
