    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome\n\nThis book is intended for anyone interested in using R for applied statistical analysis and machine learning. I first encountered R (specifically RStudio) during my master’s studies, and it wasn’t an easy journey—especially as someone from a non-coding background. Initially, I was introduced to software like SPSS and STATA, and eventually R during my master’s studies. R felt unfamiliar and complex by comparison to the previous software. However, those who could use R proficiently seemed impressive to me, which motivated me to keep going. Surprisingly, the learning process became much easier as I keep using R.\nLooking back, I wish I had known certain things earlier or that experienced R users had shared their insights from the start. This book is my attempt to provide those insights, covering the key concepts and tips I wish I had had when I started. I hope it sparks interest in R for others and helps them fully utilize its capabilities.\nFinally, I just want to say thanks to my amazing wife, Asmaq, my parents, Tengku Mokhtar and Nor Malaysia, and my in-laws, Mazalan and Salmeh, for all their understanding. Writing this book means taking the time I would usually spend with them, and while they might not fully get my obsession with R and data analysis (especially my wife!), they’ve supported me every step of the way.\nTengku Muhammad Hanis Bin Tengku Mokhtar, PhD",

    "text": "This book is designed for beginner and novice R users, with chapters structured sequentially to introduce R step-by-step, starting with foundational topics and progressing to more complex material.\nChapters 2 to 4 introduce readers to R and RStudio. For those already somewhat familiar with R, these chapters may seem straightforward and can be skipped without issue.\nChapters 5 and 6 provide essential knowledge on basic R coding, commonly used in data analysis projects. It is advised to read these chapters thoroughly before moving on, as they lay the groundwork for more advanced topics.\nChapter 7 focuses on basic visualizations and plotting techniques. Readers will learn how to use base R functions for visual representation and will be introduced to ggplot2, a highly regarded package for data visualisation in R.\nChapter 8 covers loops and functions, a topic that may pose a challenge for beginners. This chapter aims to equip readers with the skills needed for more efficient R coding. While not critical for initial learning, understanding these concepts will become increasingly important as one progresses in data analysis.\nChapters 9 and 10 delve into essential skills for data exploration and descriptive statistics. Mastering these will enable readers to gain deeper insights into their data and prepare them for more advanced analysis techniques.\nChapter 11 concludes the book by summarizing previous content and offering guidance on next steps to further enhance R and data analysis skills.\nHappy learning!",

Do not worry, this chapter is only going to cover a short version of the history of R, so, that we can appreciate this software.\nR was a successor of S language. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in 1991. R was made known to the public only in 1993. The R version 1.0.0 was released in 2000.",

Allaire, which later developed the RStudio software. RStudio software is an integrated development environment (IDE) which helps make R more user-friendly, especially for those without a programming background. RStudio IDE is unequivocally the most commonly used IDE for R software. The company, RStudio, Inc. later changed its corporation to a public benefit corporation (PBC) in 2020, thus, known as RStudio, PBC. Subsequently, in 2022, the company changed its name to Posit Software, PBC to cater to a larger demography of the data science community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The logo of Posit Software, PBC.\n\n\n\nDespite the changes in Posit company, they still strongly support the development and maintenance of RStudio IDE specifically and R in general.",

By using the str() function, we can see that R recognises the array has integer values with 3 dimensions. The first dimension, 1:2 refers to the rows, the second dimension, 1:3 refers to the columns, and the last dimension, 1:2 refers to the layers.\n\nstr(arr_data)\n\n int [1:2, 1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 13 ...\n\n\nis.array() can be used to ensure the data structure.\n\nis.array(arr_data)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Data frame\nA data frame is the extension of the matrix data structure. The difference between the former and the latter, the former contains the column names and each column may contain different data types.\n\ndf_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = 1:5,\n  Name = c(\"Mamat\", \"Abu\", \"Ali\", \"Chong\", \"Eva\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 22, 35, 28),\n  Score = c(89, 95, 76, 88, 92)\n)\ndf_data\n\n  ID  Name Age Score\n1  1 Mamat  25    89\n2  2   Abu  30    95\n3  3   Ali  22    76\n4  4 Chong  35    88\n5  5   Eva  28    92\n\n\nWe can further check the data structure and type using str(). So, our data structure is data frame, consists of 4 columns; the first column is integer, second column is character, third and fourth column are numeric.\n\nstr(df_data)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ ID   : int  1 2 3 4 5\n $ Name : chr  \"Mamat\" \"Abu\" \"Ali\" \"Chong\" ...\n $ Age  : num  25 30 22 35 28\n $ Score: num  89 95 76 88 92\n\n\nWe can double-check the data structure using is.data.frame().\n\nis.data.frame(df_data)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 List\nLastly, we have a list. So, the list is a more advanced data structure in which we can have different data structures in a data structure. Let us see the example of a list in which we combine the previous vector and matrix data structures.\n\nlist_data &lt;- list(\n  \"vector\" = vec_data,\n  \"matrix\" = mat_data\n)\nlist_data\n\n$vector\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n$matrix\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\nWe can further assess each data in the list using the $ symbol.\n\nlist_data$vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nBy using str(), we see our data is a list with 2 elements or components; a vector and matrix.\n\nstr(list_data)\n\nList of 2\n $ vector: num [1:4] 1 2 3 4\n $ matrix: num [1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nTo further confirm our data is a list, we can use is.list().\n\nis.list(list_data)\n\n[1] TRUE",

    "text": "5.3 Packages\nA package is a collection of functions and sample data that can be utilised for certain tasks. Certain functions in R are already loaded when you open R or RStudio. However, to use more advanced functions we need to install and load a package.\nThe packages can installed using install.packages(). For example the code below will install dplyr package which commonly utilise for data wrangling and manipulation.\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nTo use the installed packages, we need to load the packages using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nNow, that we know what is a package, we might wonder where exactly these packages coming from.\nThe official packages in R are located in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This link contains all available packages in CRAN. Additionally, there is CRAN Task Views. At the time of this writing, CRAN contains 21,606 R packages intended for various tasks.\nFurthermore, for those interested in bioinformatics, the related packages are located in the Bioconductor. At the time of this writing, Bioconductor contains 2,289 R packages related to bioinformatics.\nIn addition to CRAN and Bioconductor, there are unofficial R packages, which are usually located in the GitHub and GitLab. There are probably thousands of these unofficial packages. For example, dmetar which is located in GitHub, contains R functions and codes to facilitate the conduction of meta-analyses.\nMore often than not, the official packages in CRAN also have their GitHub repositories in which they contains the latest development of R functions and codes before they going to be released in CRAN. So, current bugs and errors in the package are corrected first using the unofficial packages from the GitHub or GitLab before they are eventually release to the CRAN repositories.\nThere are several packages that can help in installing the unofficial packages. The two most commonly used packages are devtools and remote (or at least I commonly used them).\nFirst, we need to install the packages.\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"remote\")\n\nNext, we can install the unofficial packages.\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"MathiasHarrer/dmetar\")\nremotes::install_github(\"MathiasHarrer/dmetar\")\n\nMathiasHarrer is referring to the GitHub account or usually the author’s account on the GitHub, followed by the name of the package. Depending on one’s preference, we can choose to use either devtools or remote.",
